# autocomplete-solidity

*An Autocomplete+ provider for Solidity.*

This package parses your Solidity files to give you contextual autocomplete suggestions. That means not only does this package give you suggestions for base constructs / types, but it will also suggest your variables, functions, contracts, etc. What's more is that it will only give you suggestions when they allowed syntax-wise. (This is based on context level so you still could get some suggestions out of place, but nothing too radical should be happening.)
